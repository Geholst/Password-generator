# Password-generator

## Description

This website was made to randomly generate a password for a user that wants one based around the parameters they want. This project was very helpful for me to get more acquainted with JavaScript. I was very overwhelmed at times, but using pseudo code and looking up more definitions w3 schools helped me be able to really focus on a singular problem and fix it before getting distracted by something else.
